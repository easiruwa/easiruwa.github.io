                                    If loving music is wrong, I don’t want to be right. It seems like the rest of the team at Spotify feels the same way—and that’s just one of the reasons why I think I’d be the perfect next hire as a software engineer intern.<br><br>
                                    Most candidates are probably drawn to Spotify for the free food, evening concerts at work, and the insanely designed office spaces (“walls” made of string!?!). And while all of those things sound awesome coming from my coffee cup covered desk in my dorm, what really attracted me to Spotify is the engineering culture.<br><br>
                                    From reading blog and social media posts, I was able to learn a lot about Spotify’s squads, tribes, and chapters. I found this to be an incredibly impressive way to keep a company, with numerous teams across 40+ cities, within an agile mindset. 
                                    The coolest thing I learned is how Spotify promotes learning and innovation by having squads spend about 10% of their time on “hack days”. Hack days are a great way to stay up to date with new techniques and tools and I can only imagine how many innovative products have come as a result. <br><br>
                                    My love for Spotify is no secret. Just ask some of my friends. I eat, sleep, and breathe this brand. Seriously. I'm not joking.<br><br> I was introduced to Spotify by my boss when I was a junior in highschool. I was sitting in her office with my friends and she was going on and on about this new and cool way she was listening to music. Being a music junky myself, I made her send me a link to the download site and the rest was history.<br><br> At first, Spotify made a huge impact on me just because it was an affordable way to listen to music. As time goes on, I've realized that Spotify has completely changed the way I listen to music. Music, for me, has become so much more social and engaging and I have Spotify to thank for that.

                                    Spotify has done so much for me and my only wish is to return the favor. I have a couple of ideas of possible features that could be implemented:
                                    <ul><li>
                                        Build machine learning algorithms that can be able to curate a list of 'People You Should Follow' based on what you listen to.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                        A feature that allows the collaborative playlist to be sharable over wifi/bluetooth. People who are in range of the host's playlist can be able to add or remove songs.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Bring back lyrics feature. (it was pretty cool)
                                        </li>
                                    </ul> I truly believe that I am qualified for this position. I’m an excellent communicator and can think quickly on my feet. I’m very adaptable and I don’t crack under pressure. I realize that this job will be demanding, but in addition to my experience as a computer science researcher and a teaching assistant, I think I am more than able to take on the challenges that I will be presented with in this internship.
